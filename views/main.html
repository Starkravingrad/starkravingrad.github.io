Garrett Criss forges his own unique craft and style to this art. Using sounds of nature and synthesized frequencies. smooth jazz inspired low-end occupies his sets. Noting artists such as Dizzy Gillespie and Django Reinhardt as some of his influences the chord progressions of his songs are vaguely reminiscent of a 40's speakeasy sit in band. Working as a classically trained audio-engineer in his free-time he's been recently sampling orchestral and opera styles into his productions for added atmosphere and ambience. This is a project for experimentation leaving no genre untouched.</p><br> <img class="lead" height="65px" width="65px" src="images/garrettcriss.jpg" alt="I'm Garrett Criss"><br> <h3>Social Media</h3> <h3>Press Kit</h3> </div>
